<h1>University Evaluation System with Solidity â›“ðŸ“š</h1>

<p>Doing a small real project, I made a smart contract, simulating the evaluation process in a university, where the only one who can evaluate and modify the notes is the teacher, however I also made some public functions where the student or any person who has a valid ID can access the notes and request revisions in case you are not satisfied.</p> 

<p>I had a lot of fun doing this project, as it has further reinforced the fundamentals of solidity that I have learned. </p>
